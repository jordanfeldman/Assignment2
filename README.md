Assignment2
===========
Due Beginning of Class Feb 11, 2014

Follow the instructions in the slides from 1/23 and 1/28 to create a Vegetable superclass. Then make Potato, Pumpkin and Onion subclasses.

Go to http://github.com/vpalat

Fork the repo “Assignment 2” and clone it to your machine – this is the app we created in class on 1/28.

Click on Assignment 2.xcodeproj to open Xcode. (If Xcode isn’t installed on your machine talk to the Lab Admins or go to : https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ for instructions on how

Take a look at the Fruit.m/Fruit.h files (and the Apple subclasses) that we made and use those as a base to create classes of Vegetables (same properties: Name, Shape, Color).

In the ViewController.m file replace all types of Fruit with Vegetable.

Init and Add a Potato, an Onion, and a Pumpkin to the cart.

Run your app.

In the “iOS Simulator” that pops up, take a screenshot (Command+S) – this will save the screenshot to the desktop.

Add that into your project by dragging it into the XCode window.

Use git to add/commit/push your changes back to your github repo.

*Please let me know immediately if there is any trouble cloning the repo. I will be happy to provide you with a link to a zip file and we can coordinate submission.
